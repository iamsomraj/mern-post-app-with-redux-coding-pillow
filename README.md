# mern post app with redux coding pillow

This repository contains a MERN stack application. In this application, one can create, read, update and delete a post. In the frontend, I have used Redux for the state management purpose. With this application in mind, one can create Todo List App, Expense Calculator App, Notes App and other similar apps.
